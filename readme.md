## Page Snapshots and Descriptions

### Home Page
The home page consists of three main sections: the hero section, carousel section, and featured-products section. The hero section is prominently displayed at the top and grabs users' attention with captivating visuals and a compelling message. The carousel section allows for dynamic content display, where users can view a series of customizable images or promotional banners. The featured-products section showcases a carefully selected collection of products that are highlighted as special or recommended. Users can easily navigate through these sections to explore various offerings and discover new items.

### Store Page
The store page serves as a comprehensive display of all the products available in the shop. It is divided into two parts to optimize the user's shopping experience. On the left side, users can easily search for specific products and conveniently add them to their shopping cart. The right side of the page contains the cart section, where users can review the contents of their cart, make changes such as adding or deleting items, and proceed to checkout when ready. This intuitive layout enables seamless product exploration and efficient management of the shopping process.

### Admin Page
The admin page serves as a powerful tool for managing the shop's product inventory. It provides a comprehensive interface where administrators can view, add, delete, and edit all the products. Each product can be assigned tags that customize its appearance and determine its location within the website. For example, using the carousel or featured tags will place a product in the carousel or featured section on the homepage, respectively. Additionally, products can be labeled with the hot or sale tags, which visually indicate if they are on sale or considered best-sellers. The admin page empowers administrators to efficiently organize and curate the shop's offerings.
